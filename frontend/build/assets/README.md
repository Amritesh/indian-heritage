This folder contains images and assets derived from the Builder export used to reproduce the Figma look-and-feel.

Place any real images here (e.g., logos, textures, icons). Current placeholders are empty files so the project compiles locally.

Examples:
- logo-large.png
- header-profile.png
- header-pattern.png
- paper-texture.png

When you have the real assets, replace these placeholder files or update `public/index.html` and CSS references accordingly.
